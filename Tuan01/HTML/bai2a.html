            <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
            <p>
                The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century. <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland.
                There, he studied under another giaut of mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor
                of physics and mathematics at St.Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time,
                publishing over 800 different books and papers. His infuence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on
                mathermatical analysis. <em>Introduction in analysin infinitorum</em> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well over
                a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <em>Letters a une princesse d'Allemagne</em> (1768-1772). giving a
                clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.

                Onr can hardly do math without coying Euler. Notation still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's
                writings. He is perhap best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula <br>
                cos(x) + isin(x) = e <sup>(ix)</sup> <br>
                demonstrates the relationship beween algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
                the equation <br>
                e <sup>(&#8719; i)</sup> + 1 = 0 <br>
                which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &#8719;, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement
            </p>

                Lenhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsupassed in the annals of mathematics.
